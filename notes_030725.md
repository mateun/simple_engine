# NOTES 03072025

We want to visualize (debug) our skeletal mesh import. 
Therefore we want to render each bone/joint with a small debug mesh
(little sphere?!). 

1. Prepare a joint mesh in Blender
2. Import the joint debug mesh. 
3. During scene rendering (in main.cpp) we shall 
   iterate all our joints for a given mesh, and 
    render the debug-mesh for each joint at the correct location.
