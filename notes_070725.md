# Notes 07072025

Our plan for today: 

- [x] Make the editor bigger
- [x] Create a separate assetbrowser panel on the right or bottom
- [x] Hook up a menu item for model import
- [x] Track the mouse and clicks for the activation of the menu item. 
- [x] Actually load / import the model: we need a file selection screen
- [x] Display the loaded model in the main 3d panel
- [x] Make a thumbnail image of the model 
- [x] Display the thumbnail in the asset browser panel
