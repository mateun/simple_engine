### Creating a dropdown menu for GameObjects
- [ ] render a colored rectangle below the actual menu item
- [ ] render the actual GameObjects sub-menu-items
- [ ] bind actions to the actual sub-menu-items
- [ ] enable child-sub-menus

#### Idea for general dropdown layer
We create a framebuffer which must be cleared to transparency.
This will then serve as our canvas to render any dropdown menu. 
Each dropdown menu will "just" provide its own position in 
screenspace, so we know where to put the dropdown menu.

Issue: currently the "activation" of the dropdown menu relies on 
hovering the "top menu item" (parent menu item). So when the user
moves the mouse into the actual dropdown area, now it would 
de-activate the dropdown menu, which is of course not correct. 
So a first quick idea is to also create a mouse-scan function which
accommodates the current dropdown areas as well.
